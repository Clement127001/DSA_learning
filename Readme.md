# Mastering Data Structures and Algorithms

Mastering data structures and algorithms means not solving the 1000's of problems on leetcode, ideally it is a way to understand the approach of various pattern of problems, like sliding window, pattern searching, ....

So the best way is to maintain consistency in learning, solving problems and to get the most out of the idea by solving the small set of problems

## prerequisites

### Having the basic understading of programming language

- What is programming language and why do we require programming language ?
- Various types of programming language like Procedural, Functional and Object Oriented Programming Language.
